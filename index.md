# Hello, World

My name is Dennis Kernighan and I'm a computer scientist working for [Gray Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisha_Gray). I'm working a small project called [ONEIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multics#Unix) — a convenient platform for programmers to run their code. I'm currently trying to re-write it in [CCPL (Compact Combined Programming Language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCPL), the programming language I helped create along with Brian Thompson, and Ken Ritchie. Both of these projects are available [on my github](https://github.com/wordz-io). 

When I'm not programming I enjoy writing books, processing strings, and teaching classes. I'm originally from Toronto, Canada and I recently completed a PhD from Princeton University. 

Feel free to reach me at my e-mail address: `<firstname><lastname>@gmail.com`.
